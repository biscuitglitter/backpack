this is a javascript-based to-do list app.

the app supports the creation of multiple projects that allow the users to organize their tasks into separate lists (projects). 
A task can hold a name, date, parent project, and priority.

it was created as part of the odin project curriculum with the purpose of learning SOLID principles
