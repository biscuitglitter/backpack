this is a javascript-based to-do list app.

the app supports the creation of multiple projects that allow the users to organize their tasks into separate lists (projects). 
A task can hold a name, date, parent project, and priority.

*project reflections* <br>

this project taught me a lot. when i started it i wasn't sure how i was going to use the class constructors to make the todos and get their values (i've never used class constructors prior to this) and i hit a major roadblock while implementing tabbing. i was stuck on it for 2-3 days until i got it right.
i tried to implement localstorage to the project, but i wasnt able to because of the way i wrote my maketodos/makeprojects functions, so i'll learn using the local storage API in a separate (simpler) project. i also regret having so many commits and i'm a little bit embarassed by it. <br>
apart from that it was a really good learning experience, its my first real project. i'm very proud of it (for now) <br>

i chose backpack because it made sense, and it was inspired by an older app made by 37signals (now basecamp) <br>
i chose it after i read their book about making web apps <br>

it was created as part of the odin project curriculum with the purpose of learning SOLID principles <br>
